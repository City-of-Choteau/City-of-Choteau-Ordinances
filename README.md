The historic record of Choteau's ordinances dating back to the founding of Choteau in 1913. I claim no rights to these documents. They are the legal ordinances of the City of Choteau and are a part of the public domain.
For accuracy's sake, please consult the original, hard bound ordinances located at Choteau City Hall and maintained by the city clerks.

Choteau's current and official code can be found at https://choteaumt.org/code
