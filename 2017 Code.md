and number of the premises where authorized card games and games of chance are
to be conducted under the license applied for. The application shall state the
names of all individuals and persons financially interested in the premises,
the license sought or the business conducted on the premises. The application
must be accompanied by satisfactory evidence that the applicant is currently
licensed for the sale of liquor, beer, food, cigarettes or any other consumable
product, and the applicant must further authorize the chief of police, or other
authorized person, to investigate the applicant's character, background and
associations, and the suitability of the premises for gaming. The license

which a gaming license is sought are not wholly owned by the applicant, the
applicant shall furnish with his application a statement of the name and
address of the owner or owners of such premises, a copy of all agreements
whereby the applicant is entitled to possession of the premises and such other

any change of ownership of any such interest in the premises wherein or whereon

separated from the gaming operation, and that as a practical matter a single
entity exists regardless of the form of organization, it may require that all
such persons be named on the license. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, such a situation may be deemed to exist in any instance where any

### 4-8-13: REFUSAL TO ANSWER QUESTIONS:
An applicant may claim any privilege afforded by the constitution of the United
States or of the state of Montana in refusing to answer questions. However, a

Each applicant shall promptly furnish the council with all additional
information pertaining to the application or to the individual applicant which
the council may require. Failure to supply the information requested within
five (5) days after the request has been received by the applicant shall
constitute grounds for delaying consideration of the application. Failure to
supply the information within two (2) weeks constitutes sufficient grounds for
denial. The information may include:
   1. Personal history records for each individual partner, joint venturer,
trustee or corporate member who has any financial interest direct or indirect
in the business entity;
   2. Fingerprint cards for each individual financially interested;

shall conduct the investigation mentioned above and who shall within one month
of receipt thereof, unless the council has granted an extension, deliver the
application and accompanying documents to the city council. If his
investigation has revealed any information that would make the applicant
ineligible for issuance of a license, he shall deliver evidence of the same to
the council. The council shall, at its next regular meeting following receipt
thereof, or at any special meeting called for that purpose consider the
application and shall notify the applicant of the hearing. The council may in

less the sum of twenty five dollars ($25.00), which shall be retained as an
application fee, shall be returned to the applicant. The council may, in its

plastics, wood, unground garbage, whole blood, paunch manure, hair and
fleshings, entrails and paper dishes, cups, milk containers, etc., either whole
or ground by garbage grinders.
   4. The following described substances, materials, waters or wastes shall
be limited in discharges to municipal systems to concentrations or quantities
which will not harm either the sewers, the sludge of any municipal system, the
wastewater treatment process or equipment, will not have an adverse effect on
the receiving stream, or will not otherwise endanger lives, limb, public
property or constitute a nuisance. The superintendent may set limitations lower
than the limitations established in the regulations below if, in his opinion,
such more severe limitations are necessary to meet the above objectives. In
forming his opinion as to the acceptability, the superintendent will give
consideration to such factors as the quantity of subject waste in relation to
flows and velocities in the sewers, materials of construction of the sewers,
the wastewater treatment process employed, capacity of the wastewater treatment
plant, and other pertinent factors. The limitations or restrictions on
materials or characteristics of waste or wastewaters discharged to the sanitary
sewer which shall not be violated without the approval of the superintendent
are as follows:
      1.   Wastewater having a temperature higher than one hundred fifty
degrees Fahrenheit (150°F) (65°C).
      2.   Wastewater containing more than twenty five milligrams per liter (25
mg/l) of petroleum oil, nonbiodegradable cutting oils or product of mineral oil
origin.
      3.   Wastewater from industrial plants containing floatable oils, fat or
grease.
      4.   Any garbage that has not been properly shredded (see section
7-2-1 of this chapter for definition of "properly shredded garbage"). Garbage
grinders may be connected to sanitary sewers from homes, hotels, institutions,
restaurants, hospitals, catering establishments or similar places where garbage
originates from the preparation of food in kitchens for the purpose of
consumption on the premises or when served by caterers.
      5.   Any waters or wastes containing iron, chromium, copper, zinc and
similar objectionable or toxic substances to such degree that any such material
received in the composite wastewater at the wastewater treatment works exceeds
the limits established by the superintendent for such materials.
      6.   Any waters or wastes containing odor producing substances exceeding
limits which may be established by the superintendent.
      7.   Any radioactive wastes or isotopes of such half-life or
concentration as may exceed limits established by the superintendent in
compliance with applicable state or federal regulations.
      8.   Quantities of flow, concentrations or both which constitute a "slug"
as defined herein.
      9.   Waters or wastes containing substances which are not amenable to
treatment or reduction by the wastewater treatment processes employed or are
amenable to treatment only to such degree that the wastewater treatment plant
effluent cannot meet the requirements of other agencies having jurisdiction
over discharge to the receiving waters.
      10.   Any water or wastes which, by interaction with other water or
wastes in the public sewer system, release obnoxious gases, form suspended
solids which interfere with the collection system, or create a condition
deleterious to structures and treatment processes.
   (E)   If any waters or wastes are discharged or are proposed to be
discharged to the public sewers, which waters contain the substances or possess
the characteristics enumerated in subsection (D) of this section, and which in
the judgment of the superintendent, may have a deleterious effect upon the
wastewater facilities, processes, equipment or receiving waters, or which
otherwise create a hazard to life or constitute a public nuisance, the
superintendent may:
      1.   Reject the wastes;
      2.   Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to the
public sewers;
      3.   Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge; and/or
      4.   Require payment to cover the added cost of handling and treating the
wastes not covered by existing taxes or sewer charges under the provisions of
subsection (K) of this section.
If the superintendent permits the pretreatment or equalization of waste flows,
the design and installation of the plants and equipment shall be subject to the
review and approval of the superintendent and the state department of health.
   (F)   Grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the
opinion of the superintendent, they are necessary for the proper handling of
liquid wastes containing floatable grease in excess amounts as specified in
subsection (D)3 of this section, or any flammable wastes, sand or other harmful
ingredients; except that such interceptors shall not be required for private
living quarters or dwelling units. All interceptors shall be of a type and
capacity approved by the superintendent and the state plumbing code, and shall

CHAPTER 4
SEWER SERVICE CHARGES
**SECTION**:
7-4-1: Purpose
7-4-2: Determining The Total Annual Cost Of Operation And Maintenance
7-4-3: Determining Each User's Wastewater Contribution Percentage
7-4-4: Determining A Surcharge System For Users With Excess BOD And TSS
7-4-5: Determining Each User's Wastewater Service Charge
7-4-6: Wastewater Facilities Replacement Fund (Rep. by Ord. 241, 10-7-1986)
7-4-7: Payment Of The User's Wastewater Service Charge And Penalties

7-4-10: Wastes Prohibited From Being Discharged To The Wastewater Treatment
System
7-4-11: Prohibition Of Clear Water Connections
7-4-12: Proper Design And Construction Of New Sewers And Connections
7-4-1: PURPOSE:
The purpose of this chapter shall be to generate sufficient revenue to pay all
costs for the operation and maintenance of the complete wastewater system. The
costs shall be distributed to all users of the system in proportion to each
user's contribution to the total loading of the treatment works. Factors such
an strength (BOD and TSS), volume and delivery flow rate characteristics shall
be considered and included as the basis for the user's contribution to ensure a
proportional distribution of operation and maintenance costs to each user (or
user class). (Ord. 228, 5-18-1982)
7-4-2: DETERMINING THE TOTAL ANNUAL COST OF OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE:
The city or its city engineer shall determine the total annual costs of
operation and maintenance of the wastewater system which are necessary to
maintain the capacity and performance, during the service life of the treatment
works, for which such works were designed and constructed. The total annual
cost of operation and maintenance shall include, but need not be limited to,
labor, repairs, equipment replacement, maintenance, necessary modifications,
power, sampling, laboratory tests and a reasonable contingency fund. (Ord. 228,
5-18-1982)
7-4-3: DETERMINING EACH USER'S WASTEWATER CONTRIBUTION PERCENTAGE:
The city, or its city engineer, shall determine for each user or user class the
average daily volume of wastewater discharged to the wastewater system, which
shall then be divided by the average daily volume of all wastewater discharged
to the wastewater system to determine such user's volume contribution
percentage. The amount used as the total average daily volume of wastewater
shall exclude infiltration and inflow. The city, or its city engineer, shall
determine for each user or user class the average daily poundage of five (5)
day, twenty degree centigrade (20°C) biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) discharged
to the wastewater system which shall then be divided by the average daily
poundage of all five (5) day BOD discharged to the wastewater system to
determine such user's BOD contribution percentage.
The city, or its city engineer, shall determine for each user or user class the
average daily total suspended solids (TSS) poundage discharged to the
wastewater system which shall then be divided by the average daily poundage of
all TSS discharged to the wastewater system, to determine such user's TSS
contribution percentage. The volume contribution percentage, BOD contribution
percentage and TSS contribution percentage for each user or user class shall be
multiplied by the annual operation and maintenance costs for wastewater
treatment of the total volume flow, total five (5) day, twenty degree
centigrade (20°C) BOD and total TSS, respectively. (Ord. 228, 5-18-1982)
7-4-4: DETERMINING A SURCHARGE SYSTEM FOR USERS WITH EXCESS BOD AND TSS:
The city, or its city engineer, will assess a surcharge rate for all
nonresidential users discharging wastes with BOD and TSS strengths greater than
the average residential user. Such users will be assessed a surcharge
sufficient to cover the cost of treating their above normal strength wastes.
Normal strength wastes are considered to be one hundred ten (110) ppm BOD and
one hundred forty (140) ppm TSS. The surcharge rate structure for such above
normal strength waste discharges is as follows:
   SURCHARGE RATE SCHEDULE FOR
   ABOVE NORMAL STRENGTH WASTES
The city, or its engineer, has determined that the average total suspended
solids (TSS) and five (5) day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) daily loadings
for the average residential user are one hundred ten (110) ppm BOD and one
hundred forty (140) ppm TSS. The city, or its engineer, has assessed a
surcharge rate for all nonresidential users discharging wastes with BOD and TSS
strengths greater than the average residential user. The surcharge will be
sufficient to cover the costs of treating such users' above normal strength
wastes. Such users will pay an additional service charge of thirty five cents
($0.35) per one thousand (1,000) gallons for each twenty five (25) ppm over one
hundred ten (110) ppm of BOD and twenty five cents ($0.25) per one thousand
(1,000) gallons for each twenty five (25) ppm over one hundred forty (140) ppm
TSS. (Ord. 228, 5-18-1982)
7-4-5: DETERMINING EACH USER'S WASTEWATER SERVICE CHARGE:
Each nonresidential user's wastewater treatment costs contributions as
determined in sections
7-4-3 and
7-4-4 of this chapter shall be added together to determine such user's annual
wastewater service charge. Residential users may be considered to be one class
of user and an equitable service charge may be determined for each user based
on an estimate of the total wastewater contribution of this class of user. The
governing body may classify industrial, commercial and other nonresidential
establishments as a residential user, provided that the wastes from these
establishments are equivalent to the wastes from the average residential user
with respect to volume, total suspended solids and BOD. Each user's wastewater
treatment cost contribution will be assessed in accordance with the rate
schedule herein:
   RATE SCHEDULE
Residential users are considered to be one class of user and are assessed a
charge of ninety six cents ($0.96) per month. Nonresidential users with flows
no greater than the average residential user's flow of sixteen thousand five
hundred (16,500) gallons per month and with BOD and TSS no greater than the
average residential user's strength of one hundred ten (110) ppm BOD and one
hundred forty (140) ppm TSS will pay the same charge of ninety six cents
($0.96) per month as the average residential user.
Nonresidential users with volumes greater than the average residential user
will pay an additional charge of six cents ($0.06) per one thousand (1,000)
gallons per month for all flows greater than the average residential user's
flow of sixteen thousand five hundred (16,500) gallons per month.
Any nonresidential user with BOD and TSS greater than the average residential
user's strength of one hundred ten (110) ppm BOD and one hundred forty (140)
ppm TSS will pay a surcharge in accordance with the rates shown in the
surcharge rate schedule. (Ord. 228, 5-18-1982)
7-4-6: WASTEWATER FACILITIES REPLACEMENT FUND:
(Rep. by Ord. 241, 10-7-1986)
7-4-7: PAYMENT OF THE USER'S WASTEWATER SERVICE CHARGE AND PENALTIES:
The city shall submit an annual statement to the user for the user's annual
wastewater service charge or one-twelfth (1/12) of the user's annual wastewater
service charge may be included with the monthly water and/or wastewater utility
billing. The city shall add a penalty of ten percent (10%) per month if the
payment is not received by the city within thirty (30) days. Should any user
fail to pay the user wastewater service charge and penalty within three (3)
months of the due date, the city may stop the wastewater service to the
property. (Ord. 228, 5-18-1982)
7-4-8: REVIEW OF EACH USER'S WASTEWATER SERVICE CHARGE:
The city shall review the total annual cost of operation and maintenance as
well as each user's wastewater contribution percentage not less often than
every two (2) years and will revise the system as necessary to assure equity of
the service charge system established herein and to assure that sufficient
funds are obtained to adequately operate and maintain the wastewater treatment
works. The city shall apply excess revenues collected from a class of users to
the costs of operation and maintenance attributable to that class for the next
year and adjust the rate accordingly. If a significant user, such as an
industry, has completed in-plant modifications which would change that user's
wastewater contribution percentage, the user can present, at a regularly
scheduled meeting of the governing body, such factual information and the city
shall then determine if the user's wastewater contribution percentage is to be
changed. The city shall notify the user of its findings as soon as possible.
(Ord. 228, 5-18-1982)
7-4-9: NOTIFICATION:
Each user will be notified, at least annually, in conjunction with a regular
bill, of the rate and that portion of the user charges which are attributable
to the wastewater treatment services. (Ord. 228, 5-18-1982)
7-4-10: WASTES PROHIBITED FROM BEING DISCHARGED TO THE WASTEWATER TREATMENT
SYSTEM:
The discharge of any waters containing toxic or poisonous solids, liquids or
gases in sufficient quantity, either singly or by interaction with other
wastes, to contaminate the sludge of any municipal systems, or to injure or
interfere with any sewage treatment process, constitute a hazard to humans or
animals, create a public nuisance, or create any hazard in or have an adverse
effect on the waters receiving any discharge from the treatment works is hereby
prohibited.
Each user which discharges any toxic pollutants which cause an increase in the
cost of managing the effluent or the sludge of the Choteau treatment works
shall pay for such increased costs.

city tree board or by natural causes shall be replaced on a one for one basis
within one year or as determined by the city tree board. The location and
species of the replacement tree shall be determined by the board. Trees of
desirable species and good health shall be protected as much as possible from
damage during construction, sidewalk repair, utilities work above and below

Other purposes of the zoning code are:
   1. To promote orderly and efficient growth and development.

   3. Protect public and private investment and to provide a high degree of
predictability and assurance to those wishing to invest in the community.

and where recommended in the growth policy.
   (E)   Provide for efficient and cost effective community services and
facilities.

9-2-3: APPLICATION FOR ZONING PERMIT:
The purpose of the zoning permit is to assure that all building construction
and development activity complies with these regulations as well as regulations
promulgated by other agencies as applicable. An application for a zoning permit

applying for a building permit. A zoning permit application may also be filed
concurrently or prior to any application for a city of Choteau business

materials, with the administrator. Once all required materials are submitted,

inspections may delay review of the permit application, and/or result in denial
of the application. (Ord. 304, 4-10-2012)
9-2-5: LIMITATIONS OF ZONING PERMIT:
Zoning permits issued pursuant to this title are limited in their authorization
to the work and/or development expressly described therein. Issuance of a
zoning permit does not convey any broad powers or authority to the applicant
beyond the purpose described in the zoning permit application and for which the
permit was issued. Zoning permits shall run with the land, are site specific,
and are not transferable to another property or site. (Ord. 304, 4-10-2012)
9-2-6: EXPIRATION OF ZONING PERMITS; EXTENSION:
If the work described in the zoning permit has not begun within one year from
the date of issuance, the permit expires and is void. The administrator shall
provide written notice to the permittee once a permit expires. Should the
permittee request in writing an extension of the zoning permit, the
administrator may grant such extension for not more than one year. Any such
request for an extension must be made prior to the actual expiration of the
zoning permit. The administrator is not empowered to reinstate an expired
zoning permit. (Ord. 304, 4-10-2012)

findings:

applicant in connection with the application were fraudulent or otherwise
inaccurate or misleading to the extent that the decision to grant the zoning
permit was based upon or influenced by said application or representations.
      2.   That operation of the authorized use or development has become a
public nuisance and/or an imminent threat to the public health, safety, and
general welfare.

by the administrator. The purpose of the CC is to ensure that all work
described on the approved zoning permit has been completed, or as applicable, a
surety for performance has been provided.

October through March, a surety may be provided in lieu of landscaping, paving,
or other improvements that do not affect the immediate and safe use of the
site, and that cannot be installed during cold weather periods. Sureties may
include letters of credit, bonds, or certified checks left on file with the
city until such time as the improvements are satisfactorily completed. Personal
or company checks cannot be accepted as sureties.

project or improvement for which the zoning permit was issued is deemed a
violation of this code. (Ord. 304, 4-10-2012)

circumstances or conditions that are unique to the subject property, and are
not generally characteristic of similarly situated properties.
      2.   Approval of the variance(s) will preserve a property right or use
that is generally enjoyed by owners of similarly situated properties, and

The general purpose of this chapter is to set forth standards for property
development, maintenance, and use that may, and usually do, apply to several
districts. Standards for parking, landscaping, measurement of setbacks and
height, and property maintenance not only will apply to almost every district
established by these regulations, but they will contribute substantially to the
preservation and enhancement of Choteau's special character and qualities.
(Ord. 304, 4-10-2012)
9-4-2: LANDSCAPING STANDARDS:
   1. Purpose And Intent: This section sets forth the standards and policies
for the design, planting, and maintenance of all required landscape areas
within the City of Choteau. The planting of trees and other landscape materials
serves to preserve and stabilize property values and enhance the built
environment of the City. Trees in particular are recognized for their
importance in shading and cooling, noise and wind reduction, open space, visual
relief, architectural enhancement, prevention of soil erosion, production of
oxygen, dust filtration, carbon dioxide uptake, providing habitat for urban
wildlife, and contributing to the aesthetic and economic value of real
property. Landscape areas that are specially designed to act as drainage
retention and snow storage areas are encouraged by the City of Choteau.
   2. Applicability: The standards set forth herein apply to all required
landscaped areas within the City of Choteau. Area required to be landscaped is
set by each zoning district as a "landscape ratio", or LSR. In addition to the
required landscape area, each property owner must also landscape and maintain
the parkway area of the street right-of-way that lies between the front
property line and the curb, pavement, or attached sidewalk as applicable. One-
and two-family residential properties and parking areas with four (4) or fewer
spaces are not subject to the landscape standards contained in this section,
but are required to provide landscaped areas as required by other applicable
sections of this Code.
   3. Landscape Plan Required: For each development where landscaping is
required under this Code, a landscape plan shall be submitted as part of the
application for a zoning permit. Landscaping that meets the standards of this
section, as well as the applicable zoning district, is required for all new
development and redevelopment. Landscape plans shall be drawn to scale and
shall include:
      1.   Symbols for each type and species of plant proposed.
      2.   Area in square feet of each part of the site to be landscaped.
      3.   A legend specifying the number and installed size of each type of
plant material.
      4.   Planting details (depth, growth medium, staking, balled and burlap,
etc. See example below).
      5.   Irrigation plan.

Typical planting detail for a multistem tree or shrub. This particular detail
does not include soil amendment, but soil amendment is recommended for the
Choteau area.
   4. Nonconforming Properties: Properties that do not meet the landscape
standards set forth in this title, but which were legally developed prior to
the effective date of this title, may continue as legally nonconforming
properties. However, additional landscaping toward meeting the standards of
this title shall be required in the event of:
      1.   The use of the property changing from one permitted use to another.
      2.   The use of the property changing from a permitted use to a special
use.
      3.   An additional structure is constructed on the subject property.
      4.   The existing floor area of all structures on the property is
increased by twenty five percent (25%) or more.
      5.   The parking area is paved and/or reconstructed.
The amount and extent of additional landscaping required on nonconforming
properties shall be to the extent practicable as determined by the
administrator.
   (E)   Selection Of Plant Materials: All plant materials should be selected
for their hardiness and survivability in the Choteau area, which is in USDA
zone 4. Specimen trees and ornamentals should be selected from the tree list
provided in appendix A of the city's master forestry plan.
   (F)   Minimum Installed Sizes: All landscape materials must meet at least
the minimum installed sizes set forth below. Trees and plants recommended for
USDA plant hardiness zone 3b are preferred.
      1.   Coniferous specimen trees (Austrian pine, blue spruce, Douglas fir,
etc.): Eight feet (8') as measured from ground surface.
      2.   Deciduous specimen trees (red oak, quaking aspen, Patmore ash, green
ash, maple, etc.): Two and one-half inch (21/2") caliper as measured one foot
(1') above the ground surface.
      3.   Ornamentals, multistem trees/shrubs (multistem aspen, amur maple,
Russian olive, Walker weeping caragana, mountain ash, crabapple, etc.): Five
feet (5') as measured from ground surface.
      4.   Shrubs (potentilla, dwarf Arctic willow, snowberry, serviceberry,
red twig dogwood, etc.): Five (5) gallon containers.
      5.   Ground covers (kinnikinik, sweetfern, cliff green, Tammy juniper,
etc.): Three (3) gallon containers. Rock, bark, and similar materials are
suitable for planting beds, but not as a general ground cover.
      6.   Turf; seeding or sodding of turf grass areas are both permitted;
grasses should be drought tolerant such as buffalo grass, blue grama,
wheatgrass, etc. Rock, bark, and similar materials may not be substituted for
turf grass.
   (G)   Planting Standards And Guidelines: This subsection contains standards
and guidelines for the number and installed size of plant materials for each
type of landscape area.
      1.   General Guidelines: For each one thousand two hundred (1,200) square
feet of landscaped area, the following plant materials should be provided.
Except for specimen trees, the quantities of plant materials are guidelines,
and varying of these guidelines to accommodate the unique features of a
development site is encouraged. However, specimen trees are required as set
forth below:
         1. One specimen tree. No more than seventy five percent (75%) of
the required specimen trees shall be either conifer or deciduous.
         2. Two (2) ornamental trees.
         3. Three (3) large shrubs/multistems.
         4. Ground cover and/or turf as appropriate.
      2.   Planting Strips: When landscape areas consist of strips no less than
six feet (6') and no more than twelve feet (12') in width (such as in setbacks
and adjacent to parking areas), the standards set forth in this subsection
shall be applied. Because planting strips have their own set of unique
standards, their area may be subtracted from the landscape area that is subject
to the general guidelines and standards above.
         1. One specimen tree for each forty (40) linear feet of strip.
Trees may be either deciduous or coniferous as appropriate for the application.
Trees need not be uniformly spaced, but may be grouped to present a more
natural looking landscape.
         2. One ornamental tree for each twenty five (25) linear feet.
Ornamentals may also be grouped or clustered for a more natural look.
         3. Adjacent to parking areas, car height screening is required. One
shrub or multistem for each ten (10) linear feet shall be provided, and may be
clustered for a natural affect. Bark or mulch may be used for the shrub bed.
For strips in side or rear setbacks that do not screen parking, shrubs are not
required.
      3.   Parking Lot Landscaping: This term refers to landscaping within the
parking area itself.
         1. Landscape Islands: Landscape islands shall be provided at least
every ten (10) parking spaces (20 spaces for a head to head arrangement).
Islands shall be the approximate length of the adjacent parking space(s) and
shall be at least eight feet (8') in width. At least one deciduous specimen
tree is required per island, and the use of conifers is highly discouraged. The
specimen tree should be selected so that it does not cause a visibility hazard
to motorists as they maneuver in the parking area. Four (4) shrubs not to
exceed three and one-half feet (31/2') in height as measured from the driving
surface are also required in each island.
         2. Landscape Strips (Between Parking Rows): The use of landscape
strips that separate two (2) rows of parking spaces is discouraged.
   (H)   Installation, Phasing, And Surety: Generally, landscaping shall be
installed prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy (CO). If no CO is
required, installation must take place prior to occupancy (residential) or
opening (nonresidential). Exceptions for landscape phasing and for building
occupancy during seasons of the year not conducive to planting are set forth
below:
      1.   Should any project for which landscaping is required be completed
and ready for occupancy between October 1 and April 15, landscape installation
may be postponed until such time as weather and soil conditions allow for
efficient installation and the best chance for survival of plant materials.
Occupancy or opening of a project may be allowed by the city of Choteau upon
the posting of a surety (bond or letter of credit) equal to one hundred ten
percent (110%) of the estimated cost of the landscape installation.
      2.   For development projects of two (2) acres or more, landscaping may
be phased over two (2) planting seasons, provided that at least fifty percent
(50%) of the required landscaping is installed during the first season prior to
opening or occupancy as set forth in subsection (H)1 of this section. In that
event, a surety shall be provided equal to one hundred ten percent (110%) of
the estimated cost of the remaining landscaping.
   (I)   Maintenance And Removal Of Dead And Diseased Plant Materials: All
required landscaping is required to be maintained in a parklike condition as it
was originally approved. All diseased or dead plant materials must be replaced
during the current or next planting season as applicable. Substitute plant
species (a different species than was shown on the original approved landscape
plan) may be approved by the administrator upon request. Failure to maintain
required landscaping is deemed a violation of this title. (Ord. 304, 4-10-2012)
9-4-3: PROPERTY MAINTENANCE:
Property maintenance standards are intended to protect neighborhood quality,
character, and property values by eliminating public health, safety, and
nuisance issues associated with the accumulation of junk, debris, and the
substandard maintenance of buildings and structures.
   1. Inoperable Vehicles And Parts: Inoperable vehicles or parts of
vehicles, including, but not limited to, auto and truck bodies, boats,
trailers, motorcycles, snowmobiles, RVs, engines, tires, rims, transmissions,
etc., may not be stored openly, except that when a vehicle is actively being
restored or repaired, the vehicle itself may be stored outdoors for no more
than thirty (30) days.
   2. Trash And Debris: No trash or debris shall be allowed to accumulate on
properties, including, but not necessarily limited to, garbage, rubbish, ashes,

waste food items, dead animals and animal parts of any kind, manure, etc.
Compost bins are allowed provided that they are restricted to side and rear
yard areas, odors are undetectable from adjacent properties, and that they do
not attract wildlife.
   4. Building Condition And Maintenance: All buildings and structures shall
be kept in a sound and livable condition and properly maintained, including
siding, roofing, paint or stain, decks, porches, balconies, and windows,
including screens and sashes. Structures are not permitted to remain in an
obvious partially constructed state without continuous progress being made to
complete the structure.
   (E)   Building Construction: During construction, all building materials and
construction waste must be contained on site. Outdoor burning of waste building
materials is not permitted within the Choteau city limits. (Ord. 304, 4-10-
2012)
9-4-4: HOME BASED BUSINESSES:
A home based business is a nonresidential accessory and incidental use of
residential property. Typically, it is a business operated from a home with
part of the floor area of the residential unit and/or an accessory structure
devoted to the business. This zoning code recognizes two (2) types of home
based businesses: home occupations and cottage industries.
   1. Home Occupations: The following standards and conditions apply to home
occupations:
      1.   Home occupations are conducted entirely within the primary dwelling
unit and/or in an attached garage, provided that at least the minimum number of
required parking spaces is maintained. Home occupations are not allowed to
operate in a detached accessory structure of any kind. Home occupations may be
operated from a single-family detached residence, duplex, townhome, or multi-
family dwelling unit.
      2.   No more than twenty five percent (25%) of the floor area of the
primary dwelling may be used for the home occupation. (Note: Floor area of an
attached garage may not be counted toward the allowable floor area for the home
occupation.)
      3.   There may be no outward appearance or visible evidence that a home
occupation is being conducted on site, except for signage permitted by
subsection (A)5 of this section.
      4.   No outdoor storage is permitted with the exception of one boat,
trailer, RV, ATV, etc., that is used in the operation of the home occupation.
Such storage is not permitted in the front yard area of the primary residence,
but may be located in a driveway provided all required off street parking
spaces are maintained.
      5.   One sign no greater than six (6) square feet is allowed. Said sign
must be wall mounted to the primary structure and is subject to a sign permit.
      6.   Home occupations are conducted solely by the resident or residents
of the dwelling, including any ARUs. No one living off site may be employed on
the premises.
      7.   No traffic shall be generated by any home occupation greater than
what would normally be expected in a residential neighborhood. Any delivery and
supply vehicles shall be no larger than those that normally make deliveries to
residential neighborhoods. Retail sales conducted on premises are expressly
prohibited as a home occupation. Retail sales may take place via
telecommunications with merchandise sent out by common carrier.
      8.   No home occupation may impact adjacent residential properties with
noise, smoke, glare, fumes, dust, or odors in excess of that which is typical
of a dwelling unit.
      9.   No home occupation shall cause visual or audible interference in any
radio or television receivers off premises, or cause fluctuations in line
voltage off premises.
      10.   Home occupations that meet the standards of this subsection may
operate as permitted uses in all residential districts. A business license from
the city of Choteau may be required.
   2. Cottage Industries: The following standards and conditions apply to
cottage industries:
      1.   Cottage industries may be conducted by any member(s) of the
household or residents of any ARU on the subject property. In addition, up to
two (2) persons who do not reside on the premises may be employed on premises
in the cottage industry.
      2.   One off street parking space for each employee not residing on
premises must be provided. Said parking shall be in a driveway or to the side
or rear of the primary residence.
      3.   The minimum lot area for a cottage industry shall be ten thousand
(10,000) square feet, and the associated residence must be a single-family
detached dwelling unit.
      4.   The maximum floor area devoted to the cottage industry shall not
exceed fifty percent (50%) of the floor area of the primary residence on the
subject property.
      5.   The cottage industry may be conducted in the home, in an attached
garage (provided that at least the minimum number of required parking spaces is
maintained), or in an accessory structure that conforms to the standards of the
applicable zoning district.
      6.   No outdoor storage is permitted with the exception of two (2) boats,
trailers, RVs, ATVs, etc., that are used in the operation of the cottage
industry. Such storage is not permitted in the front yard area of the primary
residence.
      7.   Two (2) signs are permitted for a cottage industry. One sign may be
mounted on a wooden post(s) in the front yard of the primary residence. This
sign may be no more than four feet (4') in height and six (6) square feet per
side in area. The second sign shall be mounted flat to the wall of the
structure in which the cottage industry is conducted, and near the entryway.
This sign shall not exceed two (2) square feet in area.
      8.   No cottage industry may impact adjacent residential properties with
noise, smoke, glare, fumes, dust, or odors in excess of that which is typical
of a dwelling unit.
      9.   No cottage industry shall cause visual or audible interference in
any radio or television receivers off premises, or cause fluctuations in line
voltage off premises.
      10.   Other than employees as allowed in this subsection, no traffic
shall be generated by any cottage industry greater than what would normally be
expected in a residential neighborhood. Any delivery and supply vehicles shall
be no larger than those that normally make deliveries to residential
neighborhoods. Retail sales are expressly prohibited as a cottage industry.
      11.   Cottage industries are subject to a home business permit issued by
the Choteau city council. Anyone seeking to initiate a cottage industry shall
submit an application on a form provided by the city, including an accurate
site plan of the subject property drawn to a suitable scale (1 inch = 10 feet,
1 inch = 20 feet, etc.). The application shall include the signatures of all
adjacent property owners that they have been notified of the proposed cottage
industry. An application fee shall be set by resolution of the city council.
The council may act to approve, disapprove, or approve the application with
conditions, at any regular meeting for which the agenda is published in the
city's newspaper of record. A business license from the city may also be
required. Any cottage industry that is initiated without a home business permit
and/or a business license if so required, is deemed in violation of these
regulations. (Ord. 304, 4-10-2012)
9-4-5: PREVAILING FRONT SETBACK PROVISION:
For residential structures in the A and B residential zoning districts only,
the applicant has the option of using the front setback prescribed for the
applicable district, or, the prevailing setback provision may be used as set
forth in this **SECTION**:
   1. In lieu of the prescribed front setback, the applicant may reduce the
required setback by using the mean setback of the four (4) closest dwellings on
the same side of the street.
   2. The applicant is responsible for obtaining accurate measurements of
the four (4) nearest residential structures and presenting them to the
administrator along with the application for a zoning permit.
   3. The applicant may use any dimension between the prescribed front
setback and the mean of the four (4) nearest dwelling units. (Example:
Prescribed front setback is 16 feet. The mean front setback of the 4 nearest
dwelling units is 10 feet. The applicant may use any dimension between 10 feet
and 16 feet for the front setback.)
   4. Where a maximum front setback is specified, it may not be varied
through this process. (Ord. 304, 4-10-2012)
9-4-6: STRUCTURAL HEIGHT MEASUREMENT:
The "height of a structure" is defined as the distance from the highest point
of a roof to the nearest point of finished or natural grade, whichever one is
applicable. Structural height is further determined as follows:
   1. Highest Point Of A Structure: The highest point of a structure is the
top of the highest roof pitch for a hip or gabled roof, or top of parapet for a
flat roof not including any mechanical structures. Steeples, chimneys,
antennas, receiving dishes, etc., are not subject to limitations of structural
height, except cell towers which are limited to fifty feet (50') in height.
   2. Finished Grade: Finished grade shall be construed as the grade at the
base or foundation of a structure necessary to achieve positive drainage away
from the structure only. Soil, fill, or other material may not be bermed
against a structure to circumvent height limits.
   3. Natural Grade: Natural grade shall be construed as meaning that the
natural slope and topography of the land need little or no modification to site
the structure. Where the nearest two (2) points to natural grade are at
different grades (such as a house that takes up grade through the structure),
the heights measured may be averaged. (Ord. 304, 4-10-2012)
9-4-7: SETBACK MEASUREMENTS AND ALLOWABLE ENCROACHMENTS:
   1. Front Setbacks: A required front setback is measured at a right angle
(90 degrees) from the front property line to the nearest of the following two
(2) points on the structure:
      1.   The foundation wall of the principal structure, or
      2.   The facing edge of a porch or deck over sixteen (16) square feet in
area extending from the front of the principal structure.
The following encroachments into the front setback are allowed:
Steps are allowed to encroach into the required front setback up to eight feet
(8').
Ramps to provide accessibility to disabled persons may encroach up to one
hundred percent (100%), but may not encroach onto the public right of way
without special authorization from the holder of said right of way.
Eaves may encroach up to two feet (2').
Porches and decks not exceeding sixteen (16) square feet in total area may
encroach up to four feet (4').
   2. Side Setbacks: A required side setback is measured at a right angle
(90 degrees) from the side lot line to the nearest point of the foundation
wall. Chimneys, eaves, bay windows no more than eight feet (8') in total
length, and garden windows may encroach no more than two feet (2') into the
required side setback.
   3. Rear Setback: A required rear setback is measured at a right angle
from the rear setback line to the nearest point on the foundation wall. Eaves
may encroach no more than two feet (2') and a deck or porch of no more than
sixteen (16) square feet total area may encroach no more than four feet (4').
(Ord. 304, 4-10-2012)
9-4-8: OUTDOOR LIGHTING STANDARDS:
All outdoor lighting shall be downcast and shielded. No light trespass shall be
allowed and no glare (direct sightline to an unshielded light source) shall be
visible from off site. This includes all light sources including freestanding
luminaires, building mounted lighting, and canopy lighting. (Ord. 304, 4-10-
2012)
9-4-9: OFF STREET PARKING STANDARDS:
   1. Purpose: The purpose of these standards is to provide functional
parking areas with safe and efficient circulation patterns that are adequate to
meet the needs of users while avoiding the negative environmental and urban
design impacts that can result from parking lots and other vehicular use areas.
The provisions of this section aim to protect the public health, safety, and
general welfare by avoiding spillover parking into adjacent neighborhoods,
lessening and/or mitigating traffic congestion, enhancing pedestrian safety,
reducing stormwater runoff; improving air quality through dust abatement
encouraging infill development, and providing flexible methods to respond to
the transportation and access demands of various land uses in different areas
of the community.
   2. Applicability: Generally, the standards set forth herein apply only to
new construction, new expansions of existing building or land uses, and changes
of land use that result in greater parking requirements.
      1.   Unless otherwise expressly stated, the parking standards of this
section apply whenever an existing building or use is enlarged or expanded to
include additional dwelling units, floor area, seating capacity, employees or
other units of measurement used for establishing off street parking
requirements.
      2.   In the case of enlargements, expansions, or land use changes that
require additional parking, additional spaces are required only to serve the
enlarged or expanded area, or in the case of a land use change, only the
difference in spaces required between the old and new use. There is no
requirement to address lawfully existing parking deficits unless the site is
completely redeveloped.
   3. Exemptions: As set forth in subsection
9-3-7(G) of this title, within the central business district (CB), all lodging,
governmental facilities, and residential development must provide parking
according to the standards set forth in this section. All other uses in the CB
are exempt from off street parking requirements.
   4. Calculation Of Space Requirements:
      1.   Floor Area: When parking space requirements are based on floor area,
the entire gross floor area in square feet must be calculated.
      2.   Fractions: When calculations of the required number of spaces
results in a fraction of a space, any fraction (represented as a decimal) of
less than 0.5 is rounded down to the nearest whole space. Any fraction of 0.5
or greater is rounded up to the next whole space.
      3.   Mixed Uses: If more than one type of land use occupies a single
structure or parcel of land where shared parking and access have been provided
for, the total requirement for off street parking shall be the sum of the
requirements for all uses minus ten percent (10%) of the total. If the peak
parking demands of the various mixed uses occur on different days or at
different times of the day, the land owner or developer may, upon producing
relevant data and other evidence, request a reduction in the total parking
requirement from the administrator.
   (E)   General Requirements:
      1.   Location Of Parking Spaces And Access:
         1. All required parking spaces shall be on the same lot or an
adjoining lot under the same ownership or lease with the principal building(s)
that the parking serves.
         2. In the A and B residential and BR zoning districts, parking is
prohibited in front and street side setbacks except that parking spaces may be
located in front of a garage or carport that is located outside of required
building setbacks. No more than forty percent (40%) of the front yard area in a
residential district may be paved or used for the parking or storage of
vehicles. On corner parcels, not more than twenty percent (20%) of the street
side yard area may be paved or devoted to parking or other vehicle use.
         3. In nonresidential districts, parking is permitted in all
setbacks provided it complies with standards for screening and landscaping. In
no case shall a parking space be located such that it allows a vehicle to park
across an external property line.
         4. Except for one- and two-family dwellings, no parking area shall
be designed and constructed such that vehicles are permitted to back into a
street.
      2.   Surface Material: All parking and drive areas within the city of
Choteau shall be surfaced with asphalt, concrete, or similar material, with an
adequate subsurface base to produce a long lasting, durable, weatherproof
surface. Exceptions to this standard are:
         1. One- and two-family residential development, provided that all
surfaces are kept dust free.
         2. Any parking or drive area that is accessed from an unpaved alley
or street.
         3. At the discretion of the administrator, spillover parking or
other parking that is not used on a regular and/or frequent basis may be
treated with "turf block", "grasscrete", or similar products that allow grass
or ground cover to grow in spaces between the structure of the product while
still supporting the weight of vehicles.
         4. Emergency access across open space or landscaped areas may be
treated with products described in subsection (E)2(c) of this section, subject
to approval of the administrator and local fire department.
      3.   Lighting: For parking areas of eight (8) or more spaces, lighting of
the parking area and walkways shall be provided to a 1.5 foot-candle level of
illumination. Light sources shall be directed downward and shall be shielded to
prevent spillover lighting onto adjacent properties.
      4.   Curb Stops: Where a vehicle overhang is adjacent to a walkway,
landscaped area, or a wall, curb stops are required.
      5.   Maintenance And Use: The maintenance of all parking and drive areas
is the responsibility of the property owner. The following maintenance and use
standards apply to required off street parking:
         1. Required off street parking areas must be used solely for the
temporary parking of licensed motor vehicles in operating condition.
         2. Required off street parking spaces may not be used for the
display of goods for sale or lease.
         3. Required off street parking may not be used for open storage,
storage of building materials, or storage of inoperable vehicles.
         4. Off street parking spaces must be maintained to be free of
potholes, trash, debris, dirt, and dust.
         (e)   No commercial motor vehicle repair work of any kind is permitted
in a required parking space.
      6.   Snow Storage And Drainage Retention: The design of parking
facilities with area for snow storage, drainage retention, or, both functions
within the same area, is encouraged by the city of Choteau. Such areas may be
provided within landscape areas and setbacks.
      7.   Shared Parking And Shared Access: In any development where there are
two (2) or more businesses both using the same parking area and common points
of access, the property shall be encumbered by a "shared parking, shared
access" easement. This easement may be placed on the face of the plat, or may
be filed by separate instrument. The administrator may require proof of such an
easement prior to, or as a condition of, a zoning permit.
   (F)   Parking Requirements By Use: The numbers of spaces required in this
section are minimums and shall be maintained by ownership, easement, or lease,
for as long as the land use which is served by the parking exists.
      1.   Maximum Number Of Spaces: Provision of more than one hundred twenty
five percent (125%) of the minimum number of spaces required is not permitted.
      2.   On Street Parking: No credit against the required off street parking
shall be allowed for on street spaces.
      3.   Uses Not Specifically Listed: For uses not listed in the space
requirements set forth in this subsection, the administrator shall determine
the appropriate requirement based upon any similar uses that are listed and/or
upon research.
      4.   Required Off Street Parking Spaces: The minimum number of parking
spaces by land use is as follows:

   (G)   Handicap Accessible Parking:
      1.   Handicap Accessible Spaces Required: Handicap accessible off street
parking shall be required according to the following schedule:
 
Total Spaces Provided Handicap Accessible
                      Spaces (Minimum)
   5 to 20         1
   21 to 40        2
   41 to 65        3
   66+             3% of total spaces required
 
      2.   Van Accessible Spaces: One out of each eight (8) accessible spaces
provided, but at least one space in each parking facility, shall be van
accessible.
      3.   Location: Accessible parking spaces shall be located so as to
provide the shortest accessible route to a primary building entrance.
      4.   Curb Ramps And Accessible Routes: Curb ramps and accessible routes
shall be provided which allow unobstructed travel from an accessible parking
space to an accessible entrance. Parked vehicle overhangs shall not reduce the
clear width of an accessible route. Parking spaces and access aisles shall not
exceed two percent (2%) grade in all directions.

This illustration shows 1 van accessible space and 1 car/truck space utilizing
a common accessible area. The width of each space is 8 feet. At least 1 van
accessible space is required in each parking facility.
   (H)   Dimensional Standards: This subsection sets forth standards for the
length and width of parking stalls and drive areas.
      1.   Parallel Spaces: Parking spaces designed parallel to a curb or wall
shall be at least ten feet (10') in width and 22.5 feet in length.
      2.   Ninety Degree Spaces: All ninety degree (90°) parking spaces
(perpendicular to the aisle) shall be at least ten feet (10') in width and

fifteen feet (15') in width and a two- way aisle shall be not less than twenty
two feet (22') wide. (Ord. 304, 4-10-2012)
9-4-10: DESIGN STANDARDS:
   1. Residential Design Standards:
      1.   Orientation: Each primary single-family detached residence shall
have a main entry facing the street from which the structure is addressed and
draws its legal access.
      2.   Eaves: All residential structures with pitched roofs shall have
eaves not less than twelve inches (12").
      3.   Facade Materials: Residential structures shall not be sided with
materials that are decidedly industrial in character. Materials such as
uncoated metal, unpainted block masonry, split faced masonry, and synthetic
stucco may be used for trim or architectural embellishment, but may not be used
as primary facade materials. Wood, brick, or stone (including synthetic stone)
are preferred materials.
      4.   Covered Entryways: The main entryway to a residential structure
shall be shielded by a canopy, eave, or similar structure that extends from the
exterior wall not less than four feet (4').
   2. CB Design Standards And Guidelines:
      1.   Purpose: The purpose of this subsection is to set forth basic design
standards for certain specific elements of downtown Choteau's built
environment. These standards are intended to protect the downtown's unique
character and qualities while stimulating and protecting investment, and
allowing the architect or designer the latitude to develop a creative response
to any design issue. Where standards use terms such as "must", "required", or
"shall be", they are mandatory. Where terms such as "encouraged", "preferred",
"may" or "optional" are used, the standard is considered a guideline and is
voluntary. These standards and guidelines apply to the central business zoning
district only.
      2.   Front Setbacks And Exceptions: All primary structures are required
to have a front setback from zero to five feet (5'). The administrator is
empowered to grant an exception for a front setback of no more than fifteen
feet (15') when the space between the principal structure and the front
property line is designated on the zoning permit site plan as being used for
outdoor dining, for public art, or for use as a plaza or other public gathering
place. An increased front setback to allow parking in front of a structure is
expressly prohibited.
      3.   Exterior Building Materials: Acceptable exterior building materials
for the fronts (street facing) of primary structures include wood and
manufactured woodgrain hardboard, brick, split faced block, decorative (painted
or coated) metal siding, and stone, including manufactured stone. Acceptable
materials for the sides and rear of primary structures and for accessory
structures include smooth painted concrete or cinder block, finished metal
siding of all types, synthetic stucco, exterior insulated finish system, and
vinyl exterior finishes of all types.
      4.   Exterior Colors: A wide variety of colors are acceptable in the CB
district, including muted colors with a pastel or earth tone hue and all
finished natural wood colors. Fluorescent or Day-Glo colors of any shade are
prohibited. Bright and heavily saturated primary colors are encouraged for trim
and architectural embellishments only.
      5.   Entryways: A building's primary door and entrance shall be located
in the principal facade of the structure, and shall be oriented toward the
street. The primary entrance must be readily apparent as a prominent
architectural component. Entryways should be recessed from the front property
line so that patrons have a queuing area out of the pedestrian flow. The
recessed area must be at a minimum one and one-half (11/2) times the width of
the door to avoid a corridor like effect. Doors shall permit clear two-way
visibility, and wood and glass are preferable materials.
      6.   Windows: Street level windows are required of all structures,
including the sides of structures occupying corner lots. Windows shall begin at
least three feet (3') above the sidewalk and may extend vertically to the top
of the first level. Street level windows shall be designed to engage the
pedestrian and invite visual inspection of the interior of the establishment as
well as to view displays of merchandise. Stenciled signage or other signage
types that allow visual penetration through the lettering is encouraged.
Reflective glazing is expressly prohibited. Windows may be recessed to allow
patrons to view displays out of the pedestrian flow. Bay windows may not extend
into the right of way (sidewalk area). Unframed windows are not permitted
unless set into a brick or stone like facade.
      7.   Modulation: Segments of plain or uniformly treated storefronts that
are out of context with adjacent or nearby buildings are prohibited. Such
treatments may be avoided or mitigated through modulation. In architectural
terms, modulation is a technique for visually dividing the facade so that it
takes on the appearance of distinctly different structures or portions of
structures. This architectural technique is used to add visual interest to long
storefronts or to other structures that occupy a significant segment of a
downtown block. Visual interest can also be achieved through repeating
architectural features such as windows and the elements that frame them, and
through recesses, offsets, and other variations in plane sufficient to add
shadow lines or depth to the facade.
      8.   Lighting: Outside lighting should be minimal, and downtown
businesses are encouraged to rely on ambient lighting provided by streetlights
for the safe illumination of the sidewalk area. Low wattage lighting may be
used to highlight an entryway provided no glare is cast out onto the sidewalk.
Merchants are also encouraged to illuminate window displays and interior spaces
provided that no glare is cast onto the sidewalk area. Flashing or strobe type
lighting is prohibited.
      9.   Fencing: Chainlink and other types of metal fencing shall not be
visible from the street or sidewalk.
   3. BR Design Standards And Guidelines:
      1.   Purpose: The purpose of this subsection is to set forth basic design
standards for certain specific elements of the business residential transition
area that lies between the CB and Choteau's traditional residential
neighborhoods. Like the CB standards, these standards are intended to protect
the character and qualities of the transition area and stimulate investment
while allowing the architect or designer the latitude to develop a creative
response to any design issue. Where standards use terms such as "must",
"required", or "shall be", they are mandatory. Where terms such as
"encouraged", "preferred", "may" or "optional" are used, the standard is
considered a guideline and is voluntary. These standards and guidelines apply
to the business residential zoning district only.
      2.   Exterior Building Materials: The BR transition area is more
residential in character than the CB, and this should be reflected in the
choice of exterior materials. Acceptable building materials for the fronts
(street facing) and sides of buildings include wood and manufactured woodgrain
hardboard, brick, painted or coated metal siding, and stone, including
manufactured stone. Acceptable materials for the rear of primary structures and
for accessory structures include smooth painted concrete (prestress or block),
finished metal siding of all types, synthetic stucco, exterior insulated finish
system, and vinyl exterior finishes of all types.
      3.   Exterior Colors: A wide variety of colors are acceptable in the BR
transition area, including muted colors with a pastel or earth tone hue and all
finished natural wood colors. Fluorescent or Day-Glo colors of any shade are
prohibited. Bright and heavily saturated primary colors are encouraged for trim
and architectural embellishments only.
      4.   Entryways: A building's primary door and entrance shall be located
in the principal facade of the structure, and shall be oriented toward the
street. The primary entrance must be readily apparent as a prominent
architectural component, and may include a porch, deck, or other outdoor living
space, and merchandise may be displayed in this area. Secondary entries and
exits may be provided at the sides and rear of buildings.
      5.   Windows: Lower level windows are required in all primary buildings,
and shall be viewable by pedestrians on the public way in front of the
property. Lower level windows shall be designed to engage the pedestrian and
invite visual inspection of the interior of the establishment as well as to
view displays of merchandise. Stenciled signage or other signage types that
allow visual penetration through the lettering is encouraged. Reflective
glazing is prohibited, but awnings and window coverings to shade the morning or
afternoon sun are allowed. Unframed windows are not permitted unless set into a
brick or stone like facade.
      6.   Lighting: Outside lighting should be residential like in intensity
and direction, and should be used primarily to highlight entryways and outdoor
spaces. Direct glare visible from the public way and trespass lighting onto
adjacent properties are prohibited.
      7.   Fencing: Chainlink and other types of metal fencing (except for
wrought iron) shall not be visible from the adjacent street or sidewalk.
   4. HB Design Standards And Guidelines:
      1.   Purpose: The purpose of this subsection is to set forth basic design
standards for certain specific elements of the highway business areas of
Choteau that lie mostly on the fringes of town and generally encompass the
"gateway" areas of the community. These gateway areas most often establish a
first and lasting impression of the community. Therefore, a uniformly high
standard of planning and design for the built environment of these areas
benefits the entire community. Like other standards in this chapter, these
standards are intended to set planning and design benchmarks and to stimulate
and protect private investment, while allowing the architect or designer the
latitude to develop a creative response to any design issue. Where standards
use terms such as "must", "required", or "shall be", they are mandatory. Where
terms such as "encouraged", "preferred", "may" or "optional" are used, the
standard is considered a guideline and is voluntary. These standards and
guidelines apply to the highway business zoning district only.

this Code. This section provides the standards and requirements by which legal
nonconforming lots, uses, and structures may be continued and even transferred.
It is the City of Choteau's intent that the adoption of these regulations will
render no legal lot of record "unbuildable", and that any use which was legal
and proper under prior regulations will continue to be legal and proper under
these regulations.

prior regulations, and which do not conform to these regulations, remain
legally nonconforming.

nonconforming structures as well as nonconforming uses of land, may be
transferred to heirs and assigns in a manner similar to any conforming lot,
structure, or use.
   2. Nonconforming Lots:
      1.   Legal lots of record that previously existed on the effective date
of these regulations that do not conform to these regulations due to lot area,
width, or other dimensional standard, may continue to exist as legally
nonconforming lots under these regulations.
      2.   Nonconforming lots may be developed for any of the principal
permitted, accessory, and conditional uses allowed by the applicable zoning
district.
      3.   Nonconforming lots are subject to all standards of the applicable
zoning district, including setbacks, floor area ratios, landscape ratios, and
structural height limits.
   3. Nonconforming Land Uses:
      1.   Any land use that previously existed on the effective date of these
regulations, conformed to the prior regulations, but does not conform to these
regulations, may continue to exist as a legally nonconforming land use.

case of nonresidential uses in the B Residential District, any subsequent use
of the subject property and/or structure shall conform to these regulations.

erected in connection with such nonconforming use of land or structures.
   4. Nonconforming Structures:
      1.   Any structure that previously existed on the effective date of these
regulations, which conformed to the prior regulations, but does not conform to
these regulations in terms of height, setbacks, floor area ratio, landscape
ratio, or other such standards, may continue to exist as a legally
nonconforming structure under these regulations.
      2.   No such nonconforming structure may be enlarged, expanded, or
altered in a way that increases its nonconformity, but may be altered to
decrease its nonconformity.
      3.   Should such nonconforming structure be moved for any reason and for
any distance, it shall thereafter conform to these regulations.
      4.   Should any nonconforming structure or nonconforming portion of a
structure be destroyed by any means to an extent greater than fifty percent
(50%) of its floor area, it shall not be reconstructed except in conformity
with these regulations.
      5.   Nothing in these regulations shall be deemed to prevent the
strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any structure or portion of a
structure declared to be unsafe by an official charged with protecting the
public safety, upon order of such official.
   (E)   Nonconforming Manufactured Homes:
      1.   Consistent with section
9-3-4 of this title, legally existing Class B and Class C manufactured homes in

ends is drawn to close the triangle. In most cases, this triangular area will
include both public right-of-way and private property adjacent to the right-of-
way.
